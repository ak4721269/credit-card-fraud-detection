## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of a Random Forest Classifier for fraudulent transaction detection. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset sourced from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), consisting of transactional data with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The dataset comprises [number_of_samples] samples and [number_of_features] features. Due to confidentiality reasons, the dataset cannot be included in this repository.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    ```



## Usage

1. Ensure the Jupyter Notebook environment is set up.
2. Open the `credit card fraud detection.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells.

## Results

The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 85.7% on the test set, effectively identifying fraudulent transactions. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided within the notebook.
